# Python Basics Assignment

This repository contains solutions for a basic Python assignment designed to practice core programming concepts.

## Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will be able to:

- Declare and use variables in Python
- Identify and use basic data types
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision-making
- Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate over data

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Variables & Data Types
- Declare variables of different types: string, int, float, bool, and list.
- Print each variable along with its type using the `type()` function.

### Task 2: User Input & Conditional Statements
- Ask the user to input their age.
- Use conditional statements to check if the user is eligible to vote (18+).

### Task 3: Loops
- Use a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
- Use a `while` loop to print even numbers from 1 to 20.

### Task 4: Mini Challenge
- Create a list of 5 fruits.
- Loop through the list and print each fruit in uppercase.
- Skip the fruit "banana" using the `continue` statement.

## How to Run the Code

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run the script using:

```bash
main.py
